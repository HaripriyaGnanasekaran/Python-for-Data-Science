# Data Science
While self teaching Data Sciene to myself, I created this repository. As a process I developed many jupyter notebooks as class notes. Some of them are easy to read. Feel free to contribute or edit the mistakes in the notebooks. 


Contains:
* Python tutorials (for applications to Data Science and AI)
