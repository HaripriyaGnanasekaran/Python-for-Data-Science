Idea of this repository is to create an machine learning application using Python. 
Initially many small problems like predicting the price of a car, predicting factors influencing housing price, predicting rate of spread of virus to a specific location etc., will be implemented with a future outlook to create a large scale machine learning implementation. 

#### Future of this repository
In the large scale implementation, focus is to create an AI Scientific advisor to governmental policies. Other ideas that arise during the developmental phase can replace the motive with a newer, better ones. 


#### Current projects

##### 1. Predict the price of car from its attributes.
This is the first small scale implementation. This project uses the data from UCI website. Data consists of features of car and the price it was sold in the year of 1985. This analysis will thus not predict the car prices accurately for this year. However, the idea is create a basic framework. Provided with a recent data, the hope is that the small program can predict the car price accurately.

Data of used car prices were analyzed using the python script. Below you see some of the data visualization, normalization techniques used. Both linear and multiple regression models from the Python sklearn (class) linear_model (method) are used. This project is still under developement. Preliminary results are know however.
