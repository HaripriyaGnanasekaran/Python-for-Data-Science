While self teaching Data Sciene to myself, I created this repository. As a process I developed many jupyter notebooks as class notes. Some of them are easy to read. Feel free to contribute or edit the mistakes in the notebooks. 

# Future of this repository
In future, all my own works related to machine learning and AI will be deposited here. Dream project is to create a AI coach for badminton men's singles games.

#### Business understanding.
Can we make an model to predict the necessary shots to be played by a player after analyzing the recorded video until first break?
Can we make a model to predict the win and loss percentage based on the shots played and increment in win/loss ratio if the advice based on shots are followed?

#### Analytical approach
Probably we need to combine unsupervised learning with decision tree classification. 
Combine tools like Linear regression to see correlation and choose the important atribute.

#### More to come in future ....
